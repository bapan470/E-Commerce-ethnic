 * them into swatch dots on a single card. A product with 7 colours turns
 * into 7 separate cards in the grid, each linking straight to that exact
 * colour's own product page.
 *
 * Mirrors exactly how the product-detail page represents a variant as a
 * `Product` (see the `useMemo` merging `variant` onto `baseProduct` in
 * app/product/[slug]/product-detail.tsx): same `id`, only `slug`,
 * `colors`, and `images` swapped to that colour's own. Keeping `id`
 * unchanged means Add-to-Bag / wishlist / cart-line-matching (which all
 * key off `product.id` + `colors[0]`, see `itemColor` in
 * lib/cart-context.tsx) keep working exactly as they do from the PDP —
 * each colour still lands in its own cart line, and the wishlist heart
 * still refers to the same underlying product record.
 *
 * Cards render via the ordinary <ProductCard>, which already hides its
 * own swatch-dot row when a card has nothing left to switch between
 * (`variant_list` cleared to `[]` below) — so an exploded card shows
 * just its own photo, no redundant dots for colours already shown as
 * separate cards.
