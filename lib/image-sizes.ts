/**
 * lib/image-sizes.ts
 * 
 * Shared utility: generate 3 responsive sizes from a sharp buffer.
 * Used by upload-image and import-image routes.
 * 
 * Sizes:
 *   -sm  → 480px  (mobile product cards, thumbnails)
 *   -md  → 900px  (desktop product cards, category pages)
 *   original → 1600px (full product page zoom)
 * 
 * Existing images (no -sm/-md suffix) are untouched — loader falls back
 * to original URL for them.

/**
 * Generate WebP + AVIF buffers at 3 different sizes from a source buffer.
 * Returns array of { suffix, buffer, contentType, ext } — 2 entries per
 * size (one WebP, one AVIF), so 6 entries total when nothing fails.
 *
 * The resize step is only ever done ONCE per size — the resized pipeline
 * is branched into .webp({...}) and .avif({...}) so we don't pay for two
 * separate resizes of the same source.
 *
 * AVIF generation is wrapped in its own try/catch per entry: if AVIF
 * encoding fails for a given size, only that AVIF entry is skipped (and
 * logged) — the matching WebP entry for that size is completely
 * unaffected, so WebP output/upload always keeps working even if AVIF
 * has a problem for some source image.
