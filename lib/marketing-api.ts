export const SHIPPING_POLICY_TEMPLATE = `Order Processing
Orders are processed and dispatched within {{dispatch_days}} business days of order confirmation, excluding Sundays and public holidays. During sale periods, processing may take slightly longer.

Delivery Timelines
Metro cities: {{metro_days}} business days after dispatch
Other cities/towns: {{other_days}} business days after dispatch
Remote/rural areas: may take up to {{remote_days}} business days

These are estimated timelines and may vary depending on courier partner delays, weather conditions, or other unforeseen circumstances.

Shipping Charges
Free shipping on all orders above {{free_shipping_threshold}}. A flat shipping charge of {{shipping_fee}} applies on orders below that amount.

Order Tracking
Once your order is dispatched, you will receive a tracking link via email/WhatsApp/SMS to track your shipment in real time.

Delivery Attempts
Our courier partners typically make up to 2-3 delivery attempts. If delivery is unsuccessful, the order may be returned to us, and you will be contacted to arrange re-delivery (additional shipping charges may apply).

Damaged or Incorrect Items
If you receive a damaged, defective, or incorrect item, please contact us within 48 hours of delivery with photos/video of the product and packaging, and we will arrange a replacement or refund as per our Refund & Cancellation Policy.

International Shipping
We currently ship only within India and do not offer international shipping at this time.`;

export const REFUND_POLICY_TEMPLATE = `Order Cancellation
You may cancel your order within {{cancellation_hours}} hours of placing it, provided it has not already been shipped. To cancel, contact us immediately with your order number.

Returns and Exchanges
We accept returns/exchanges within {{return_days}} days of delivery, provided the item is:

Unworn, unwashed, and unused
In its original packaging with all tags intact
Not a sale/clearance item (unless defective)

Certain items such as blouses that have been stitched or altered as per customer requirements are not eligible for return.

How to Initiate a Return
Contact us with your order number and reason for return. Once approved, we will arrange a free reverse pickup (where serviceable) at no extra cost to you. In areas where reverse pickup is not serviceable, we will share the return address with you and reimburse reasonable return shipping charges once the return is verified.

Refunds
Once we receive and inspect the returned item, refunds will be processed within 5-7 business days to your original payment method. For Cash on Delivery orders, refunds will be issued via bank transfer or store credit, as per your preference.

Damaged or Defective Items
If you receive a damaged, defective, or wrong item, please reach out within 48 hours of delivery with clear photos/video, and we will offer a free replacement or full refund, whichever you prefer.`;

export const PRIVACY_POLICY_TEMPLATE = `AruhiHandlooms ("we", "us", "our") operates the website aruhihandlooms.com. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store and protect your personal information when you visit our website or make a purchase.

Information We Collect
We collect information you provide directly to us, including your name, email address, phone number, shipping and billing address, and payment details when you place an order, create an account, or contact us. We also automatically collect certain information such as your IP address, browser type, and browsing behaviour on our site through cookies and analytics tools.

If you take part in optional programs on our site, we also collect information needed to run them: your loyalty points balance and history if you join our loyalty program; your unique referral code and the status of people you refer if you use our referral program; the recipient's name and email address if you purchase a gift card for someone else; your business name and reseller/wholesale account details if you join our reseller or wholesale programs; and the name, rating, comment, and any photos you submit if you write a product review (which may be displayed publicly on the relevant product page).

How We Use Your Information
We use your information to:
Process and fulfil your orders, including shipping and delivery
Communicate with you about your orders, account, or customer service requests
Send you promotional emails or WhatsApp messages, only if you have opted in
Operate optional programs you choose to join, such as loyalty points, referrals, gift cards, coupons, and reseller/wholesale accounts, and to calculate and apply any related rewards or discounts
Display product reviews and ratings you choose to submit
Improve our website, products, and customer experience
Detect and prevent fraud, including misuse of discounts, referral codes, or gift cards

Payment Information
All payments are processed through secure, PCI-DSS compliant payment gateways (including Razorpay). We do not store your full card details on our servers. Where we offer an additional discount for paying online instead of Cash on Delivery, this is applied at checkout only and does not involve collecting any extra personal information beyond your chosen payment method.

Sharing of Information
We do not sell your personal information. We may share your information with trusted third parties who help us operate our business, including payment processors, shipping and logistics partners (such as Delhivery), and email/SMS service providers, solely for the purpose of fulfilling your order and communicating with you.

Cookies
Our website uses cookies to remember your cart, preferences, and to understand how visitors use our site. You can disable cookies through your browser settings, though some features of the site may not work correctly as a result.

Data Security
We take reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect your personal information from unauthorised access, alteration, or disclosure.

Your Rights
You may request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal data by contacting us at contact@aruhihandlooms.com. You may also unsubscribe from marketing communications at any time.

Children's Privacy
Our website is not directed at children under 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

export const TERMS_CONDITIONS_TEMPLATE = `Welcome to AruhiHandlooms (aruhihandlooms.com). By accessing or using our website, you agree to be bound by the following Terms & Conditions. Please read them carefully before making a purchase.

General
These terms apply to all visitors, users, and customers of aruhihandlooms.com. By placing an order, you confirm that you are at least 18 years old or are using the site under the supervision of a parent/guardian.

Products
We make every effort to display our products, including colours and fabric details, as accurately as possible. However, slight variations in colour may occur due to photography, lighting, and screen settings, as our sarees and ethnic wear are handwoven/handcrafted and may have natural variations.

Pricing and Payment
All prices listed on the website are in Indian Rupees (INR) and are inclusive of applicable taxes unless stated otherwise. We accept payments through the payment methods listed at checkout. We reserve the right to change prices at any time without prior notice, though this will not affect orders already confirmed.

Order Confirmation
An order is confirmed only after successful payment and receipt of an order confirmation email/message from us. We reserve the right to cancel any order due to stock unavailability, pricing errors, or suspected fraudulent activity, in which case a full refund will be issued.

Discounts, Coupons and Online Payment Discount
From time to time we may offer coupon codes, checkout add-on offers, or an additional discount for choosing to pay online instead of Cash on Delivery. Any such discount is shown to you at checkout before you complete your order and applies only to that order; it is not a permanent price reduction, cannot be combined with other offers unless stated, has no cash value, and may be changed, withdrawn, or restricted (including by order value, product, or payment method) at our discretion without prior notice.

Loyalty Points Program
If enabled, our loyalty program lets you earn points on qualifying purchases, which can be redeemed for a discount on future orders once you reach the minimum redemption threshold shown on the site. Points have no cash value, are non-transferable, cannot be sold or exchanged, may be reversed if the related order is cancelled or returned, and may expire or be adjusted as described in the program details on the site. We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the loyalty program at any time.

Referral Program
If enabled, our referral program lets existing customers invite others to shop with us in exchange for reward points for both the referrer and the referred customer, as described on the site at the time of referral. Referral rewards are credited only once the referred customer's qualifying order is completed and are subject to the same non-cash, non-transferable terms as loyalty points. We reserve the right to withhold or reverse rewards, and to suspend accounts, in cases of suspected abuse, self-referral, or fraud, and may modify or discontinue the program at any time.

Gift Cards
Gift cards purchased on our site are valid for the period shown at the time of purchase from the date of issue, are redeemable only for purchases on aruhihandlooms.com, cannot be redeemed for cash (in whole or in part) except where required by law, and are non-refundable once issued. You are responsible for keeping your gift card code secure; we are not liable for gift cards lost, stolen, or redeemed without authorisation due to a code being shared or compromised. Unused balances after expiry may be forfeited, subject to applicable law.

Reseller and Wholesale Program
We may allow eligible customers to join our reseller or wholesale program to purchase products at a different price for resale, subject to the terms shown at the time of joining. Participants in this program act on their own behalf and are independently responsible for their own pricing, marketing, and representations to their end-customers; AruhiHandlooms is not a party to and is not liable for arrangements between a reseller/wholesale participant and their customers. We reserve the right to approve, suspend, or terminate any reseller or wholesale account at our discretion.

Product Reviews
When you submit a product review, you confirm the content is your own genuine opinion and that you have not been paid or incentivised to post it unless we have explicitly disclosed otherwise. We may moderate, edit for length, or decline to publish reviews that are abusive, irrelevant, contain personal information about others, or otherwise violate these Terms, and may remove any review at our discretion.

Intellectual Property
All content on this website, including images, logos, and text, is the property of AruhiHandlooms and may not be reproduced or used without our written permission.

Limitation of Liability
AruhiHandlooms shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the use of our website or products, to the extent permitted by law.

Governing Law
These Terms & Conditions are governed by the laws of India. Any disputes shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in North 24 Parganas, West Bengal, India.

Changes to Terms
We may revise these Terms & Conditions at any time. Continued use of the website after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.
