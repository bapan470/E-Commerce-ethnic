// Public, read-only feed of every product/colour-variant that has a video
// attached — backs the full-screen Reels-style "video shopping" overlay.
// Ordered newest-first so freshly uploaded videos surface first, same as a
// real short-video feed. No pagination: catalogs with a video on every
// product are still small enough (dozens, not thousands) that a single
// query is simpler and fast enough; revisit with a `range()` cursor if
// the video catalog grows into the hundreds.
//
// IMPORTANT: a colour variant can have its OWN video (product_variants.video)
// that's completely separate from the base product's video_url. Previously
// this route only looked at `products.video_url`, so opening the video
// trigger/peek from a variant page whose video lives only on the variant row
// meant `startProductId` was never found in this feed — the reel silently
// fell back to index 0 (some unrelated product) instead of the video the
// shopper actually meant to watch. Both the base product row AND every
// videoed variant row are now included as separate feed entries (keyed by
// their own id), and app/product/[slug]/product-detail.tsx passes the
// active variant's id (falling back to the base product id) so it always
// matches an entry here.
